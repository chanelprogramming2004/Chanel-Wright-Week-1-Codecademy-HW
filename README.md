Project Description â€” WanderNote I converted a div-heavy travel page into clean semantic HTML. Replaced &lt;div> elements with proper tags like &lt;header>, &lt;main>, &lt;article>, and &lt;footer>, added alt text for images, and improved heading structure and accessibility while keeping the same visual design.
